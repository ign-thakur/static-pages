    <h1>Terms &amp; Conditions — KartmaX Checkout</h1>
    <p class="muted">Last updated: 13 November 2025</p>

    <p>These Terms &amp; Conditions ("Terms") set out the rules for use of the KartmaX Checkout service ("Service") operated by KartmaX ("we", "us", "our"). By integrating, using or accessing the Service (including via our API, SDK, or dashboard) you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

    <h2>1. Who these Terms apply to</h2>
    <p>These Terms apply to merchants, platforms, developers, and other business entities ("Merchant(s)") that integrate KartmaX Checkout to accept payments from their end customers ("End Customers"). If you are an End Customer, your relationship is primarily with the Merchant and these Terms govern aspects of how our Service operates in support of the Merchant.</p>

    <h2>2. Services Provided</h2>
    <p>KartmaX provides a checkout orchestration and payment integration platform: routing payments to third-party payment processors, managing coupons/offers (where supported), aggregating payment statuses, logging transactions, and related services. We may provide SDKs, APIs, a dashboard, and documentation.</p>

    <h2>3. Merchant Responsibilities</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Maintain lawful business operations and accurate information in your KartmaX account.</li>
      <li>Comply with payment network rules, card brand rules, and local laws (tax, KYC, AML).</li>
      <li>Provide accurate product, pricing, and refund policy information to End Customers.</li>
      <li>Keep API keys, credentials and secrets secure. You are responsible for actions taken using your credentials.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Payment Processing</h2>
    <p>We do not itself acquire card payments. Payments are processed by third-party payment processors or gateways (e.g., Razorpay, Gokwik, other processors you choose). The applicable processor's terms will govern the processing relationship, fees, and liabilities for transactions processed through them. We may collect, store, and expose payment metadata needed to reconcile transactions; we do not store full card PANs or CVV.</p>

    <h2>5. Fees</h2>
    <p>Use of KartmaX Checkout may be subject to fees. Fees for payment processing (gateway fees, settlements) are charged by the payment processor. KartmaX may charge platform/service fees as agreed in your merchant agreement or subscription plan. Fees, billing cycles, and payment terms will be provided on the merchant dashboard and invoices.</p>

    <h2>6. Offers & Coupons</h2>
    <p>KartmaX may surface offers and coupons through integrated gateways. Eligibility, applicability, and redemption of offers are subject to the terms of the payment provider or the issuing party. In case of discrepancies between displayed offers and final application of discounts, the processor’s eligibility check will prevail.</p>

    <h2>7. Refunds & Chargebacks</h2>
    <p>Refunds and chargeback handling flow through the payment processor and/or merchant. KartmaX will assist with logging and event data, but final dispute resolution and financial outcomes are determined by the processor and card networks. Merchants are responsible for responding to chargebacks and maintaining records.</p>

    <h2>8. Data & Privacy</h2>
    <p>Use of personal data is governed by the KartmaX Privacy Policy. Merchants must provide accurate privacy disclosures to End Customers and obtain any required consents for data collection and sharing with processors.</p>

    <h2>9. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>KartmaX retains all rights, title and interest in the Service, platform software, documentation, and trademarks. Merchants are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Service to accept payments and integrate according to documentation.</p>

    <h2>10. Warranties & Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>We provide the Service "as is" and "as available" to the maximum extent permitted by law. KartmaX disclaims all warranties, whether express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.</p>

    <h2>11. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, KartmaX's aggregate liability arising out of or related to these Terms will not exceed the amounts actually paid by the Merchant to KartmaX in the 12 months preceding the claim. We are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages (including loss of profits or business interruption).</p>

    <h2>12. Indemnity</h2>
    <p>Merchants shall indemnify and hold KartmaX harmless from claims, damages or losses arising from Merchant's breach of these Terms, misuse of the Service, violation of applicable law, or acts of fraud by the Merchant or its customers.</p>

    <h2>13. Termination</h2>
    <p>We may suspend or terminate access to the Service for breaches, illegal activity, high fraud risk, or at our discretion with notice. Termination does not relieve Merchant of outstanding payment obligations or liabilities accrued before termination.</p>

    <h2>14. Modifications</h2>
    <p>We may modify these Terms from time to time. Material changes will be communicated in the merchant dashboard or by email. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.</p>

    <h2>15. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction specified in your merchant agreement (if any). Absent a specific merchant agreement, Indian laws will govern disputes, and parties agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the competent courts in New Delhi, India. This clause can be updated per merchant contract.</p>

    <h2>16. Export Controls & Compliance</h2>
    <p>Merchants will comply with applicable export controls, sanctions, anti-money laundering, and counter-terrorism financing laws. We reserve the right to refuse service where required by law or policy.</p>
